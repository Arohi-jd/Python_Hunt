  <h1>Python Comments - Page 4</h1>

  <h2>Single-line Comments</h2>
  <p>
    In Python, single-line comments are created using the hash symbol (#). Anything written after the hash symbol on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter.
    Single-line comments are typically used to add explanations or notes to the code for better understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <pre>
    <code>
      # This is a single-line comment
      print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints a greeting
    </code>
  </pre>

  <h2>Multi-line Comments</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike some other programming languages, Python doesn't have a built-in syntax for multi-line comments. However, you can use triple quotes (either single or double) to create multi-line strings, which can act as multi-line comments.
    These multi-line strings are not assigned to any variable, so they are essentially treated as comments by the interpreter.
  </p>

  <h2>Example:</h2>
  <pre>
    <code>
      '''
      This is a multi-line comment.
      It spans multiple lines.
      '''
      print("Hello, World!")
    </code>
  </pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Comments are useful for documenting your code and making it more readable. They help you and others understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the code.
    By using single-line and multi-line comments effectively, you can improve the maintainability of your Python programs.
