    <h1>Loops In Python</h1>
    <p>Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>1. While Loop in Python</h3>
<p>
    In python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
</p>
<b>Syntax</b>
</div>

<div>
    <pre>
        <code>
            while expression:
                statement(s)
            # Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements. 
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<b>Example of Python While Loop </b>
<div>
    <pre>
        <code>
            a = 0
            while (a < 3):
                a = a + 1
                print("Hi")
            #<b>Output:</b> Hi 
                     Hi
                     Hi
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<b>While Loop with else Condition</b>
<div>
<pre>
    <code>
            a = 0
            while (a < 3):
                a = a + 1
                print("Hi")
            else:
                print("In Else")
            #<b>Output:</b> Hi 
                     Hi
                     Hi
                     In Else
    </code>
</pre>
</div>

<b>Infinite While Loop in Python</b>
<div>
<pre>
    <code>
        count = 0
        while (count == 0):
            print("Hello Geek")
        #It is not Recommended to use Infinite Loop as you may need to forcefully terminate the compiler
    </code>
</pre>
</div>


<div>
    <h3>2. For Loop in Python</h3>
    <p>In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, which can be a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or any other iterable object. The for loop allows you to perform a set of operations on each item in the sequence.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <b>Syntax</b>
    <pre>
        <code>
            for var in sequence:
                statements(s)
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Here are some examples of using for loops in Python:</p>
    
    <b>1. Looping through a List:</b>
    <pre>
        <code>
            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            for fruit in fruits:
                print(fruit)
            
            # <b>Output:</b>apple
                     banana
                     cherry
        </code>
    </pre>
    <b>2. Looping through a String:</b>
    <pre>
        <code>
            text = "Hello"
            for char in text:
                print(char)
            # <b>Output:</b>H
                     e
                     l
                     l
                     o
                
        </code>
    </pre>
    <b>3.  Looping through a Range:</b>
    <pre>
        <code>
            # You can also use the range() function to create a sequence of numbers and loop through it.
            for i in range(5):  # Loops from 0 to 4
                print(i)
            # <b>Output:</b>0
                     1
                     2
                     3
                     4

        </code>
    </pre>
    <b>4. Looping through a Dictionary:</b>
    <pre>
        <code>
            # When iterating through a dictionary, you can access both keys and values using the .items() method.
            person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
            for key, value in person.items():
                print(f"{key}: {value}")
            # <b>Output:</b>name:John
                     age:30
                     city:New York
        </code>
    </pre>
    <b>5. Nested for Loops:</b>
    <pre>
        <code>
            # You can nest for loops to loop through multiple sequences, creating a loop within a loop.
            for i in range(2):
                for j in range(2):
                    print(f"({i}, {j})")
            # <b>Output:</b>(0,0)
                     (0,1)
                     (1,0)
                     (1,1)
        </code>
    </pre>
    
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Loop Control Statements</h3>
    <p>In Python, loop control statements allow you to control the flow of loops (e.g., for and while loops). There are three main loop control statements:</p>
    
        
            <b>1. break Statement</b>
            <p>The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When a break statement is encountered within a loop, it immediately terminates the loop, and control is passed to the code following the loop. This is useful when you want to exit a loop based on a certain condition.</p>
            <b>Example</b>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    for number in range(1, 11):
                        if number == 5:
                            break  # Exit the loop when number is 5
                        print(number)
                    # <b>Output:</b>1
                             2
                             3
                             4
                </code>
            </pre>

        
        
            <b>2. continue Statement:</b>
            <p>The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It is often used when you want to avoid executing some code in a particular iteration but continue with the loop.</p>
            <b>Example</b>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    for number in range(1, 6):
                        if number == 3:
                            continue  # Skip number 3
                        print(number)
                    # <b>Output:</b>1
                             2
                             4
                             5
                </code>
            </pre>

        
       
            <b>3. pass Statement:</b>
            <p>The pass statement is a placeholder statement that does nothing. It is often used when a statement is syntactically required but you don't want to execute any code. It is commonly used when you are designing a function or class and want to add the implementation later.</p>
            <b>Example</b>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    for letter in 'geeksforgeeks':
                        pass
                    print('Last Letter :', letter)

                    # <b>Output: </b>s
                </code>
            </pre>
